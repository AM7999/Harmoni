uhhh idfk how to type a good readme uhh um 

keybinds are dfjk (cant be changed yet)

to fullscreen pressed f11 on the song select menu

to edit settings edit settings.lua

and uhh to import your own songs, open quaver, export a song, then extract the files from the QP, then go into the folder Harmoni/Music and create a new folder. 
name this folder the name of the song, with no slashes or periods.
drag the desired QUA into the file converter.py (make sure you have python installed to path), then rename the created file "chart.lua".
take the audio file from the chart and rename it to "audio.mp3". 
finally, take the background file and rename it to "background.jpg"
put all that into the folder you created in the Music folder and then run the game. 
the converter doesnt work for all quaver songs and idk why so if it doesnt work try another song i guess idfk
